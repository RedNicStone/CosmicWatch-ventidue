# CosmicWatch Ventidue


## Advantages of the new design
- Lower manufacuring cost for the full conicidence detector on a single unit. Flexible design with one or two detectors
- Ethernet interface for comunnication with other detectors and remote monitoring
- Optional sensores and periphals can be added without soldering via the on board headers. Possible devices include a BMP280 for air pressure, temperature and humidity, a Adafruit mini GPS and persice temperature compensated RTC (DS3231)
- Easy assembly due to hand solder friendly footprints and parts
- Powerfull Teensy 4.1 microcontroller
- Built in silicon coincidence detector with time resolution of about 5ns
- Greatly improved user interface with rotary encoder and big colorfull OLED display (128Â² pixels on 1.5" with 16bit color)
- Software driven buzzer for audible counts and interface feedback
- Improved mechanical stablility of the scinitlator assembly
- 3D printable enclosure
- Entirely open source hardware & software
- Fast interrupt driven software architecture for acurrate counting and a responsive user interface
